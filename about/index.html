      <section class="page__content" itemprop="text">
        
        <p>Hello, I’m Henning Mohr, a seasoned researcher with over 10 years of experience at the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au">University of Western Australia</a>, where I specialise in geotechnical and hydrodynamical problems related to the offshore renewable energy sector. Throughout my research career, I have been passionate about designing, building, and improving experimental equipment to achieve the best possible measurements for a range of applications.</p>

<p>I hold a Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Technical University of Darmstadt (Germany, 2010) and a Doctorate in Offshore Engineering from the University of Western Australia (Australia, 2016). My research interests have spanned multiple disciplines, including mechanical, coastal, hydrodynamical, and geotechnical engineering, which have resulted in numerous articles featuring my experimental setups that I developed. You can check out some highlights of my research on my <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Henning-Mohr">Research Gate page</a>.</p>

<p>My deep understanding of the science involved, together with my expertise in mechanical engineering, has enabled me to develop advanced experimental equipment and produce invaluable research output. Throughout the years, I have been involved in the design and construction of research devices, as well as the execution of experiments, across multiple research laboratories, including (i) <a href="http://www.ngcf.edu.au">National Geotechnical Centrifuge Facility (NGCF)</a>, (ii) the soils laboratories of the <a href="https://www.cofs.uwa.edu.au/capabilities/facilities/geotechnical-testing-laboratory">University of Western Australia</a> and <a href="https://www.ngi.no/en/">Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI)</a> soils laboratory and the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/facilities/coel">Coastal and Offshore Engineering Lab (COEL)</a>. I gained significant industry experience, particularly in the offshore energy sector, where I have carried out research experiments directly on board of a vessel or provided consulting advice for companies listed in the FTSE 100 and ASX 200.</p>

<p>Through my company, I am committed to producing the highest quality instrumentation available, and every stage of design, testing, and production is driven by this quality standard.</p>

<h2 id="the-roots">The Roots</h2>

<p>In 2015, I co-founded MSMT Solutions with a friend, with the aim of providing advanced measurement solutions for the research sector. Initially, we started with modest beginnings and developed a pressure sensor specifically targeted for geotechnical research applications. This was due to the need for an alternative to the obsolete ‘Druck’ pressure sensor typically used in geotechnical centrifuge testing. The successful development of the pressure sensor led to follow-on work, where we provided customised sensors for a hydrodynamical research project. The customised pressure sensors were used to instrument a small diameter pipe in an experimental program at the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/facilities/coel">Coastal and Offshore Engineering Lab (COEL)</a>, to investigate the pressure distribution around cables.
From there, our work continued to grow, primarily through word-of-mouth recommendations. We developed other research equipment for universities around the world, including the <a href="https://www-geo.eng.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>, <a href="https://www.feps.soton.ac.uk">University of Southampton</a> <a href="https://civil.queensu.ca/Research/Geotechnical/index.html">Queen’s University</a>. Our customers were extremely satisfied with our products and services, leading to a constant demand for follow-on work.
In 2023, we decided to expand our services to the broader research community, with the goal of positioning MSMT Solutions as a leading company that researchers can rely on to help them realise their projects. Our commitment to providing high-quality products and services, along with our proven track record of success, has made MSMT Solutions the preferred choice for researchers worldwide.</p>

<h2 id="the-vision---what-goes-around-comes-around">The vision - What goes around, comes around.</h2>

<p>The concept of establishing MSMT Solutions was born out of the necessity to develop superior instrumentation and measurement solutions for the research sector, which we understand very well. We have found that industrial solutions often fail to meet the mark because of their proprietary hardware and software. Our belief is that knowledge-sharing and open-source resources will lead to better research outcomes. We have always favoured the use of open-source products in the past, and we have experienced the freedom to pursue our objectives without restrictions as a result. Some of the open-source software and hardware that we use on a regular basis includes <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> for our Operating System, <a href="www.python.org">Python</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a> for general coding and user software, <a href="https://micropython.org">Micro-Python</a> for programming micro controllers, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio</a> as an editor for our coding,  <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> for sharing codes, <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a> to create reports and documents, <a href="http://www.linuxcnc.org">LinuxCNC</a> for our CNC machinery, <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/">Prusa i3</a> and <a href="https://octoprint.org">Octoprint</a> to provide our 3D printing services.</p>

<p>Our goal is to collaborate, create, share, and be empowered to inspire future learning with an open-source approach in mind. As a result, measurement solutions created and designed by MSMT for our instrumentation will be openly available on <a href="https://github.com/MSMT-Solutions">GitHub</a> and will be governed by the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT agreement</a>. By developing precise measurement data acquisition and control hardware, as well as instrumentation, we help leading university laboratories advance cutting-edge research and push the boundaries of innovation.</p>
